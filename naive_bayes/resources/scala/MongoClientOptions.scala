/**
 * Various settings to control the behavior of a [[org.mongodb.scala.MongoClient]]
 *
 * @param description the description for this MongoClient, which is used in various places like logging.
 * @param readPreference the read preference to use for queries, map-reduce, aggregation, and count.
 *                       Default `ReadPreference.Primary()`
 * @param writeConcern The write concern to use. Default is `WriteConcern.ACKNOWLEDGED`.
 * @param primitiveCodecs The primitive codecs to use. Default is `PrimitiveCodecs.createDefault()`
 * @param minConnectionPoolSize The minimum number of connections per server for this MongoClient instance.
 *                              Those connections will be kept in a pool when idle, and
 *                              the pool will ensure over time that it contains at least this minimum number.
 *                              Default `0`
 * @param maxConnectionPoolSize The maximum number of connections allowed per host for this MongoClient instance.
 *                              Those connections will be kept in a pool when idle. Once the pool is exhausted,
 *                              any operation requiring a connection will block waiting for an available
 *                              connection. Default is `100`.
 * @param threadsAllowedToBlockForConnectionMultiplier this multiplier, multiplied with the maxConnectionPoolSize
 *                                                     setting, gives the maximum number of threads that may be waiting
 *                                                     for a connection to become available from the pool. All further
 *                                                     threads will get an exception right away. For example if
 *                                                     `maxConnectionPoolSize` is `10` and
 *                                                     `threadsAllowedToBlockForConnectionMultiplier` is `5`, then up
 *                                                     to `50` threads can wait for a connection.  Default is `5`.
 * @param maxWaitTime The maximum wait time in milliseconds that a thread may wait for a connection to become
 *                    available. Default is `120,000`. A value of `0` means that it will not wait.
 *                    A negative value means to wait indefinitely.
 * @param maxConnectionIdleTime The maximum idle time of a pooled connection.  A zero value indicates no limit to the
 *                              idle time.  A pooled connection that has exceeded its idle time will be closed and
 *                              replaced when necessary by a new connection.
 * @param maxConnectionLifeTime The maximum life time of a pooled connection.  A zero value indicates no limit to the
 *                              life time.  A pooled connection that has exceeded its life time will be closed and
 *                              replaced when necessary by a new connection.
 * @param connectTimeout The connection timeout in milliseconds.  A value of `0` means no timeout. It is used solely
 *                       when establishing a new connection `java.net.Socket#connect(java.net.SocketAddress, int)`.
 *                       Default is 10,000.
 * @param socketTimeout The socket timeout in milliseconds. It is used for I/O socket read and write operations
 *                      `java.net.Socket#setSoTimeout(int)`. Default is `0` and means no timeout.
 * @param socketKeepAlive This flag controls the socket keep alive feature that keeps a connection alive through
 *                        firewalls. `java.net.Socket#setKeepAlive(boolean)`. Default is `false`.
 * @param autoConnectRetry If true, the driver will keep trying to connect to the same server in case that the socket
 *                         cannot be established. There is maximum amount of time to keep retrying, which is `15s` by
 *                         default. This can be useful to avoid some exceptions being thrown when a server is down
 *                         temporarily by blocking the operations. It also can be useful to smooth the transition to a
 *                         new master (so that a new master is elected within the retry time). Note that when using
 *                         this flag: - for a replica set, the driver will trying to connect to the old master for
 *                         that time, instead of failing over to the new one right away - this does not prevent
 *                         exception from being thrown in read/write operations on the socket, which must be handled
 *                         by application.
 *
 *                         Even if this flag is `false`, the driver already has mechanisms to automatically recreate
 *                         broken connections and retry the read operations. Default is `false`.
 * @param maxAutoConnectRetryTime The maximum amount of time in MS to spend retrying to open connection to the same
 *                                server. Default is `0`, which means to use the default `15s` if autoConnectRetry is on.
 * @param SSLEnabled Whether to use SSL. The default is `false`.
 * @param heartbeatFrequency This is the frequency that the driver will attempt to determine the current state of each
 *                           server in the cluster. The default value is `5000` milliseconds.
 * @param heartbeatConnectRetryFrequency This is the frequency that the driver will attempt to determine the current state of
 *                                       each server in the cluster, after a previous failed attempt. The default value is `10` milliseconds.
 * @param heartbeatConnectTimeout the connect timeout for connections used for the cluster heartbeat.  The default value is `20,000` milliseconds.
 * @param heartbeatSocketTimeout  the socket timeout for connections used for the cluster heartbeat.  The default value is `20,000` milliseconds.
 * @param requiredReplicaSetName the required replica set name.  With this option set, the MongoClient instance will
 *                               1. Connect in replica set mode, and discover all members of the set based on the given servers
 *                               2. Make sure that the set name reported by all members matches the required set name.
 *                               3. Refuse to service any requests if any member of the seed list is not part of a replica set with the required name.
